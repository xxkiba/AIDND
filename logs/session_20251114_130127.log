You MUST follow this ReACT tool-calling protocol. When you need data from the local catalog or Open5e, you MUST call tools.
Do NOT narrate or describe your intentions. Instead, output exactly one tool call block:
  <CALL>{"fn":"function_name","args":{...}}</CALL>
After the system executes the tool, it will append a system message beginning with:
  Observation: { ... }
You may think again, optionally call more tools, and ONLY AFTER calling fetch_and_cache, produce the final user-facing answer.
Never include <CALL> in your final answer.

Available functions:
- look_monster_table(query:str, limit:int=20)
- search_table(type:str, name_or_slug:str, prefer_doc:str|None)
- fetch_and_cache(type:str, slug:str)

Supported resource types (for search_table & fetch_and_cache):
  monsters, spells, equipment, backgrounds, classes,
  conditions, documents, feats, planes, races,

2025-11-14 13:02:08,024 | INFO | The spell **Fireball** is a 3rd-level evocation spell in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It is known for its explosive power and is a staple in many spellcasters' arsenals. Here are the key details:

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** Verbal, Somatic, Material
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **School:** Evocation

**Description:**
Fireball allows the caster to hurl a fiery mote to a point within range, where it explodes in a burst of flame. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Higher Levels:**
When you cast Fireball using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. This means at 4th level, it deals 7d6 damage, at 5th level 8d6, and so on, up to 12d6 at 9th level.

Fireball is a powerful area-of-effect spell that can deal significant damage to multiple targets, making it a favorite choice for dealing with groups of enemies.

2. **Skill Proficiencies**: You are proficient in History and one of the following: Arcana, Culture, Engineering, or Religion.

3. **Equipment**: You start with a bottle of ink, a pen, 50 sheets of parchment, and common clothes.

4. **Library Privileges**: As a fellow or friend of several universities, you have visiting access to great libraries, which are usually off-limits to the general public. With enough time spent in a library, you can uncover most answers you seek (any question answerable with a DC 20 Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, or Religion check).

5. **Adventures and Advancement**: When visiting libraries and universities, you may be asked for help due to your adventurer status. After assisting with esoteric knowledge or academic disputes, you might gain access to restricted library areas containing deeper mysteries.

6. **Connection and Memento**: You have a connection and a memento that ties into your background. Connections could be a rival, a former student, or a noble sponsor, while mementos might include an incomplete manuscript or a magic quill pen.

This background is ideal for characters who wish to have a deep connection to academia and access to vast amounts of knowledge, making it perfect for wizards, scholars, and other intellectual characters.

      "slug": "wizard",
      "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. \n \n#### Spellbook \n \nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n \n> ### Your Spellbook \n> \n> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. \n> \n> **_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. \n> \n> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. \n> \n> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. \n> \n> **_Replacing the Book._** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. \n> \n> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. \n> \n> **_The Book's Appearance._** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. \n \n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher \n \nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the Your Spellbook sidebar).\n \n### Arcane Recovery \n \nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. \n \nFor example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. \n \n### Arcane Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Spell Mastery \n \nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. \n \n### Signature Spells \n \nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \n### Arcane Traditions \n \nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. \n \nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.",

Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. \n \n##### Evocation Savant \n \nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. \n \n##### Sculpt Spells \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. \n \n##### Potent Cantrip \n \nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. \n \n##### Empowered Evocation \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. \n \n##### Overchannel \n \nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. \n \nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.",

But clever and cautious wizards sometimes specialize in such spells because while other mages fret when they're depleted of arcane resources, Cantrip Adepts hardly even notice  and at their command, the cantrips are not so humble.\n\n##### Cantrip Polymath\nAt 2nd level, you gain two cantrips of your choice from any spell list. For you, these cantrips count as wizard cantrips and don't count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any other source, such as from a racial trait or feat, counts as a wizard cantrip for you.\n\n##### Arcane Alacrity\nAlso at 2nd level, whenever you cast a wizard cantrip that has a casting time of an action, you can change the casting time to a bonus action for that casting. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, you regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Potent Spellcasting\nStarting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard cantrip you can cast.\n\n##### Adroit Caster\nStarting at 10th level, if you cast a cantrip that doesn't deal damage or a cantrip that has an effect in addition to damage, such as the speed reduction of the *ray of frost* spell, that cantrip or effect has twice the normal duration.\n\n##### Empowered Cantrips\nStarting at 14th level, once per turn, when you cast a wizard cantrip that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

In addition, you can still perform the somatic components of wizard spells even when you have a longbow or shortbow in one or both hands.\n\n##### Unseen Assailant\nStarting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can choose a target you can see within 60 feet of you and become invisible to that target until the start of your next turn. Once the effect ends, you can't use this feature on that target again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Arrow\nBeginning at 6th level, you can imbue an arrow you fire from a longbow or shortbow with magical energy. As a bonus action, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to cause the next arrow you fire to magically deal an extra 2d4 force damage to the target on a hit. If you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.\n\n##### Pinpoint Weakness\nAt 10th level, when you hit a creature with an arrow imbued by your Spell Arrow feature, your next ranged weapon attack against that creature has advantage.\n\n##### Multitudinous Arrows\nStarting at 14th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action with a longbow or shortbow on your turn. If you use your Spell Arrow feature, you can imbue both arrows with arcane power by expending one spell slot. If you imbue two arrows with this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.",

          "desc": "Each wizard has a strong connection with their familiar, but some mages eschew specializing in a school of magic in favor of forming a powerful bond with a familiar. This bond allows the two to work in tandem in ways that few arcane practitioners could even dream of. Those who encounter such a familiar never look at a rodent or bird the same way again.\n\n##### Familiar Savant\nBeginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn the *find familiar* spell if you don't know it already. You innately know this spell and don't need to have it scribed in your spellbook or prepared in order to cast it. When you cast *find familiar*, the casting time is 1 action, and it requires no material components.\n  You can cast *find familiar* without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, when you cast the *find familiar* spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth (see *Creature Codex*), or giant armadillo (see *Tome of Beasts 2*). The familiar has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.\n\n##### Greater Familiar\nAlso at 2nd level, when you cast *find familiar*, your familiar gains the following additional benefits: \n* Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are proficient. \n* Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher. It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level. \n* In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the familiar can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. \n* Your familiar's attacks are enhanced by the magic bond you share with it. When making attack rolls, your familiar uses your spell attack bonus or its normal attack bonus, whichever is higher. In addition, when your familiar hits with an attack, the attack deals force damage equal to 1d4 + its Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus instead of its normal damage. If the familiar's attack normally deals additional damage, such as a flying snake's poison, or has an additional effect, such as an octopus's grapple, the familiar's attack still has that additional damage or effect. \n* Your familiar's Intelligence increases to 8 unless it is already higher. It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).\n\n##### Strengthened Bond\nStarting at 6th level, your magical bond with your familiar grows stronger. If your familiar has a trait or action that forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. In addition, you can access your familiar's senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard spell you cast. If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, you must be sharing your familiar's senses before casting the spell. If the spell requires an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your own statistics to adjudicate the result.\n\n##### Arcane Amplification\nStarting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard spell you cast through your familiar. In addition, your familiar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\n##### Companion Concentration\nStarting at 14th level, when you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower, you can use an action to draw on your connection with your familiar to pass the burden of concentration onto it, freeing you up to concentrate on a different spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

Gravebinders focus their efforts on safeguarding tombs and graveyards to ensure the dead remain at rest and the living remain safe from the dead. When undead rise to prey upon the living, a gravebinder hunts downs the abominations and returns them to their eternal slumber.\n\n##### Restriction: The Dead Must Rest\nWhen you choose this wizard arcane tradition, you can no longer cast spells that animate, conjure, or create undead, and, if any such spells are copied in your spellbook, they fade from the book within 24 hours, leaving blank pages where the spells were.\n\n##### Gravebinder Lore\nAt 2nd level, you can use an action to inscribe a small rune on a corpse. While this rune remains, the corpse can't become undead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, you have proficiency in the Religion skill if you don't already have it, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks made to recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the afterlife.\n\n##### Hunter of the Dead\nStarting at 2nd level, you gain access to spells passed down by generations of gravebinders. The *heart to heart* (2nd), *dead walking* (3rd), *gird the spirit* (3rd), *life from death* (5th), and *lay to rest* (9th) spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook at the indicated wizard levels (see the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells). Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n  Also at 2nd level, you can use your action and expend one wizard spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether undead are present within 1 mile of you. You know the general direction of the undead creatures, though not their exact locations or numbers, and you know the direction of the most powerful undead within range.\n\n##### Ward Against the Risen\nStarting at 6th level, when an undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you targets an ally with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to hamper the attack or spell. The undead has disadvantage on its attack roll or your ally has advantage on its saving throw against the undead's spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Disruptive Touch\nBeginning at 10th level, when an undead creature takes damage from a 1st-level or higher spell you cast, it takes an extra 4d6 radiant damage. Undead creatures you kill using this feature are destroyed in a puff of golden motes.\n\n##### Radiant Nimbus\nAt 14th level, you can use your action to envelope yourself in a shroud of golden flames for 1 minute. While enveloped, you gain the following benefits: \n* When you summon the flames and as an action on each of your turns while the flames are active, you can frighten undead within 30 feet of you. Each undead creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the flames fade or until it takes damage. An undead creature with sunlight sensitivity (or hypersensitivity, in the case of vampires) also takes 4d6 radiant damage if it fails the saving throw. \n* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. \n* When an undead creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 2d10 radiant damage.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

          "desc": "Liminal spaces are spaces on the boundary, at the edge between what's real and what's unreal. A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both *here and there* at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated: the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass.\n  These are only the most obvious encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked, being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as unassumingly familiarand as fraught with potentialas a doorway that's crossed a hundred times without incident.\n  Those who specialize in liminal magic are known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional moments to their own ends. Like filaments of a dream, strands of liminality can be woven into forms new and wondrousor strange and terrifying.\n\n##### Liminal Savant\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a liminal spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) into your spellbook is halved.\n\n##### Mulligan\nAt 2nd level, you can control the moment between an attempt at something and the result of that attempt to shift the flow of battle in your favor. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses with an attack, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the attack. Similarly, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll the attack and use the lower result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, you can use this feature when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw.\n\n##### Otherworldly Sense\nAt 6th level, if you spend 1 minute meditating and expanding your senses outward, you can sense those not of this worldthose who slip through the cracks of the in-between to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting. For 10 minutes, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. As long as you maintain your concentration, you can use an action to change the type of creature you sense. You know the direction to each lone creature or group, but not the distance or the exact number in a group. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Liminal Adept\nAt 10th level, you add the *threshold slip* spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) to your spellbook, if it isn't there already. You can cast *threshold slip* without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can bring up to two willing creatures of your size or smaller that you're touching with you. The target junction must have unoccupied spaces for all of you to enter when you reappear, or the spell fails.\n  You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature three times between rests.\n\n##### Forced Transition\nAt 14th level, your mastery over moments of change is unequivocal. You can use an action to touch a willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an unwilling creature, choosing one of the following effects. The effect lasts for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Rapid Advancement.*** The target's ability scores are each increased by 2. An ability score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n***Regression.*** The target's ability scores are each reduced by 2. This effect can't reduce an ability score below 1.\n\n***True Self.*** The target can't change its shape through any means, including spells, such as *polymorph*, and traits, such as the werewolf 's Shapechanger trait. The target immediately reverts to its true form if it is currently in a different form. This option has no effect on illusion spells, such as *disguise self*, or a creature that appears changed from the effects of an illusion, such as a hag's Illusory Appearance.",

          "desc": "Some wizards pride themselves on being spell artisans, carefully sculpting the magical energy of spells like smiths sculpt iron. Focusing on the artistry inherent in spellcasting, these wizards learn to tap the magical energy of spells and manipulate that energy to amplify or modify spells like no other arcane practitioners.\n\n##### Arcane Emendation\nBeginning when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can manipulate the magical energy in scrolls to change the spells written on them. While holding a scroll, you can spend 1 hour for each level of the spell focusing on the magic within the scroll to change the spell on the scroll to another spell. The new spell must be of the same school, must be on the wizard spell list, and must be of the same or lower level than the original spell. If the new spell has any material components with a cost, you must provide those when changing the scroll's original spell to the new spell, and the components are consumed as the new spell's magic overwrites the original spell on the scroll.\n\n##### Spell Transformation\nAt 2nd level, you learn to mold the latent magical energy of your spells to cast new spells. While concentrating on a wizard spell that you cast using a spell slot, you can use an action to end your concentration on that spell and use the energy to cast another wizard spell you have prepared without expending a spell slot. The new spell must be half the level (minimum of 1st) of the spell on which you were concentrating, and the new spell's casting time must be 1 action.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Honing\nAt 6th level, you can hold onto the magic of lasting spells or siphon off some of their magic to amplify spells you cast. If your concentration is broken (willingly or unwillingly), the spell's magic lingers, causing the spell's effects to remain until the end of your next turn.\n  In addition, while concentrating on a spell with a duration of concentration up to 1 minute or concentration up to 10 minutes, you can amplify a wizard spell you cast of 1st level or higher. When you amplify a spell in this way, the duration of the spell on which you are concentrating is reduced by a number of rounds (if the duration is concentration up to 1 minute) or minutes (if the duration is concentration up to 10 minutes) equal to the amplified spell's level. You can choose only one of the following options when amplifying a spell: \n* Increase the saving throw DC by 2 \n* Increase the spell attack bonus by 2 \n* Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell\n  You can amplify a spell this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Reversion\nAt 10th level, you learn to manipulate the magical energy of spells cast against you. When you must make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, such as the frightened condition of the fear spell or the slowing effect of a copper dragon's slowing breath, you have advantage on the saving throw.\n  In addition, when an ongoing condition you successfully end on yourself was from a spell cast by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make the same saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn on a failed save.\n\n##### Spell Duality\nAt 14th level, you become a master at manipulating and extending the magical energy of your longlasting spells. You can concentrate on two spells simultaneously. If you cast a third spell that requires concentration, you lose concentration on the oldest spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, you make one saving throw for each source of damage, as normal. You don't have to make one saving throw for each spell you are maintaining.\n  If you are concentrating on two spells and fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration because of taking damage, you lose concentration on the oldest spell. If you are concentrating on two spells and lose concentration on both spells in 1 round, you suffer one level of exhaustion.",

Necromancy, pyromancy, geomancy, all come from *manteia*, different methods of seeing that which cannot be seen by normal means. So, whether you are reading tea leaves or interpreting charred scapula bones, your magic allows you to perceive things beyond the normal boundaries of space and time. Kings and commoners ignore your warnings only at their own periland you are an asset in any party undertaking risky endeavors, though your comrades might get sick of hearing your refrain, \"I told you so.\"\n\n##### Expert Diviner\n\nStarting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you only need to spend half as much time and gold as normal in order to copy a spell into your spellbook if the spell is from the divination school.\n\n#### Premonition\n\nAlso at 2nd level, you begin to see in your dreams brief images of events yet to unfold. After finishing a long rest, you can make two d20 rolls and keep track of the results for later. Any time before the next time you complete a long rest, when you or a creature visible to you is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to stop the roll from happening and instead use one of the results from your premonition.\n\nYou can only use this feature once per turn, and after you have used a result from your premonition, you cannot use it again. Any result not used before your next long rest are lost as false premonitions and cannot be used either.\n\n#### Soothing Savant\n\nStarting at 6th level, you are so skilled at soothsaying that you gain more spellcasting power when you use your divinations. Any time you use a spell slot to cast a divination spell of at least 2nd level, you regain one of your spell slots that youve expended for the day. A spell slot regained in this way must be lower than 6th level as well as lower than the spell level you used to activate the feature.\n\n#### Extrasensory Perception\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can extend your senses beyond their normal capabilities. At any time, you may choose one of the following options and gain the associated benefit until you take a short or a long rest or are incapacitated. You can only use this feature once per short or long rest.\n\n***Ether Sight.*** You can see creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane up to 60 feet away.\n\n***Script Sight.*** You can comprehend writing in any language as if it were written in your native tongue.\n\n***Shadow Sight.*** You get darkvision with a range up to 60 feet, or increase the range of your darkvision to 60 feet if you already have it.\n\n***Unseen Sight.*** You gain the power to see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible at a range of 10 feet within your line of sight.\n\n#### Premonition Addition\n\nBeginning at 14th level, when you use your Premonition feature, you may roll and record the results of three d20s as your resting hours fill with further visions.",

They can create the appearance of an object where none is, and they can also hide real creatures and objects from sight. They can dazzle and disorient with flashes of color, or call forth a targets deepest inner fears. Practitioners of illusions and phantasms are often some of the most creative wizards, as every time they call upon one of their signature spells, they can make a unique experience for the situation. This school is particularly popular among gnome wizards, who have a history of relying on illusory magic to keep themselves hidden and safe from larger foes.\n\n##### Expert Illusionist\n\nStarting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you only need to spend half as much time and gold as normal in order to copy a spell into your spellbook if the spell is from the illusion school.\n\n##### Enhanced Cantrip\n\nAt 2nd level, you gain one additional cantrip, either _minor illusion_ or, if you already knew this spell, then another that you choose. Your mastery of this spell is such that, when you cast it, you can create an illusory image and a sound with the same casting. When calculating your cantrips known per level, this spell does not count against your total.\n\n##### Mutable Mirage\n\nAt 6th level, you can use your action to alter the illusion created by a spell you previously cast. You can only use this feature on spells with a duration of at least 1 minute, and you must be able to see the illusion when you alter it. You cannot change the illusion in a way not allowed by the initial casting of the spell.\n\n##### Second Semblance\n\nStarting at 10th level, if you are the target of an attack roll by another creature, you can substitute an illusion of yourself between you and your attacker. You use your reaction, causing the attack to miss you and hit the illusion, and your illusion vanishes afterwards. You can use this feature once per short or long rest.\n\n##### Phantasmagoria\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can draw energy from the plane of shadow to give parts of your illusions a temporary physical essence. Any time after you cast an illusion spell of at least 1st level, while the spell is in effect, you can use a bonus action to apply this power to a single nonmagical, inanimate object within the illusion of the spell. For 1 minute, this object can be physically interacted with, but it cant be used to deal damage.\n\nAs an example, you could create an illusory staircase and scale it, or create an illusory portcullis to bar a pursuer, but you could not dispatch an enemy by dropping an illusory boulder on them.",

Sure, a fireball is scary, but these masters of the dark arts deal with the forces of life and death like they were mere playthings. They can drain life from the living and force the dead to heed their beck and call. Practitioners of the necromantic arts have a reputation for evil, but they are not universally so (even if they tend to always be at least a little dark and edgy). Necromancers can also be heroic forces for good in the world, though they may need to have some flexible morals when it comes to sourcing the raw materials for their undead minions.\n\n#### Expert Necromancer\n\nStarting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you only need to spend half as much time and gold as normal in order to copy a spell into your spellbook if the spell is from the necromancy school.\n\n#### Dark Reaper\n\nAlready at 2nd level, you become adept at harvesting the animus from living beings killed by your spells. Up to once per turn, when you use a spell of 1st level or higher to kill at least one creature, you may regain lost hit points up to twice the level of the spell used. If the spell in question belongs to the necromancy school, you may instead regain hit points up to three times the level of the spell. This ability is not triggered by killing creatures without a life force, namely constructs and the undead.\n\n#### Undead Minions\n\nWhen you reach 6th level, if you do not already know the spell *animate dead*, you add it to your spell book. When you cast this spell, you may target one more pile of bones or corpse than specified by the spells description, creating an additional minion of the appropriate type.\n\nIn addition, any undead you create with a spell from the necromancy school gains the following benefits:\n\n* Increase the creatures hit point maximum by a number equal to your wizard class levels.\n* When making weapon damage rolls, the creature adds your proficiency bonus to the total.\n\n#### Necrotic Acclimation\n\nAt 10th level, your familiarity with the necrotic arts has hardened you against some of their effects. You gain resistance against necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can never be reduced.\n\n#### Control Undead\n\nBeginning at 14th level, you are able to take control of the undead, even if you did not create them with your own magic. You can use your action to target an undead creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw versus your wizard spell save DC, its attitude towards you becomes friendly and it obeys any commands you issue it until the next time you use this feature. If the target succeeds its saving throw, it becomes permanently immune to this effect.\n\nIf the undead creatures Intelligence score is 8 or higher, it makes the saving throw to resist control with advantage. If its Intelligence score is 12 or higher and it fails its first saving throw, it can repeat the save to break free once every hour it remains under your control.",

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \n \nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \n \n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n \nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \n \nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A). \n \n##### Mindless Rage \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. \n \n##### Intimidating Presence \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. \n \nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. \n \n##### Retaliation \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.",

Once per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, you push the target 5 feet away from you, and you can choose to immediately move 5 feet into the targets previous position. ##### Stance of the Mountain\nYou harness your fury to anchor your feet to the earth, shrugging off the blows of those who wish to topple you. Upon choosing this path at 3rd level, you cannot be knocked prone while raging unless you become unconscious.\n\n##### Demolishing Might\nBeginning at 6th level, you can muster destructive force with your assault, shaking the core of even the strongest structures. All of your melee attacks gain the siege property (your attacks deal double damage to objects and structures). Your melee attacks against creatures of the construct type deal an additional 1d8 weapon damage.\n\n##### Overwhelming Cleave\nUpon reaching 10th level, you wade into armies of foes, great swings of your weapon striking many who threaten you. When you make a weapon attack while raging, you can make another attack as a bonus action with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\n\n##### Unstoppable\nStarting at 14th level, you can become unstoppable when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of the rage your speed cannot be reduced, and you are immune to the frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions. If you are frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, you can still take your bonus action to enter your rage and suspend the effects for the duration of the rage.

Until the beginning of your next turn, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.\n  Until the rage ends, if a creature within 5 feet of you that heard your Roar of Defiance deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to bellow at them. Your attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The damage you deal with this feature increases to 2d6 at 10th level. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, you can't use this feature on that creature again during this rage.\n\n##### Running Leap\nAt 3rd level, while you are raging, you can leap further. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap a number of feet equal to your Strength score. With a 10-foot running start, you can long jump a number of feet equal to twice your Strength score.\n\n##### Lion's Glory\nStarting at 6th level, when you enter your rage, you can choose a number of allies that can see you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until the rage ends, when a chosen ally makes a melee weapon attack, the ally gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to the Rage Damage bonus you gain, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.

Each creature that ceases to be frightened gains 1d12 + your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) temporary hit points for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Victorious Roar\nAt 14th level, you exult in your victories. When you hit with at least two attacks on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to unleash a victorious roar. One creature you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

The way these aspects manifest is up to you and can include sprouting horns from your head, changing the color of your skin, growing fangs or a tail, or other small physical changes. Though infused with fiendish power, you aren't a fiend.

This effect works like the fire shield spell, except you are surrounded with a warm shield only and it ends when your rage ends. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n#####Devilish Essence\nAt 14th level, while raging, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and if you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level.",

If you are already proficient in Stealth, you gain proficiency in another barbarian class skill of your choice.\n\n##### Mistwood Defender\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the Reckless Attack feature on ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons, and, while you aren't within melee range of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, you can draw and throw a thrown weapon as a bonus action.\n  In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon using Strength while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the damage you deal with the thrown weapon.\n\n##### From the Mist\nBeginning at 6th level, mist and fog don't hinder your vision.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### War Band's Passage\nStarting at 14th level, when you use your From the Mist feature to cast misty step, you can bring up to two willing creatures within 5 feet of you along with you, as long as each creature isn't carrying more than its carrying capacity.

When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier + damage of the type associated with your totem dragon equal to your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Legendary Might\nStarting at 6th level, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature twice between long rests.\n\n##### Aspect of the Dragon\nAt 10th level, you take on additional draconic features while raging. When you enter your rage, choose one of the following aspects to manifest.\n\n***Dragon Heart.*** You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your barbarian level. Once you manifest this aspect, you must finish a short or long rest before you can manifest it again.\n\n***Dragon Hide.*** Scales sprout across your skin. Your Armor Class increases by 2.\n\n***Dragon Sight.*** Your senses become those of a dragon.

While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless it is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\n\n##### Wyrm Lungs\nAt 14th level, while raging, you can use an action to make a breath weapon attack. You exhale your breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier), taking 12d8 damage of the type associated with your totem dragon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks you make using that skill.\n\n##### Battle Fervor\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can expend one additional daily use of rage to allow a number of willing creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you to enter a rage as well.

Alternatively, if you end your rage and other creatures are also raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, you and each creature affected by your Battle Fervor regains a number of hit points equal to your barbarian level + your Charisma modifier.\n\n##### Thunderous Oratory\nAt 14th level, while you are raging, your attacks deal an extra 2d6 thunder damage. If a creature is raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, its weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage.

If you take damage before your first turn, you can enter a rage as a reaction, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from the triggering attack.\n  When you reach 8th level in this class, you get 1 extra reaction on each of your turns. This extra reaction can be used only for features granted by the Path of the Inner Eye, such as Insightful Dodge or Preemptive Parry. When you reach 18th level in this class, this increases to 2 extra reactions on each of your turns.\n\n##### Insightful Dodge\nBeginning at 6th level, when you are hit by an attack while raging, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet. If this movement takes you beyond the range of the attack, the attack misses instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Foretelling Tactics\nStarting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack while raging, up to two creatures of your choice who can see and hear you can each use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed toward the creature you hit and make a single melee or ranged weapon attack against that creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Preemptive Parry\nAt 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls. If the result is still a hit, reduce the damage dealt by your weapon damage die + your Strength modifier.",

The first barbarians of this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others access to this power.\n  Though named for the thorns that covered the first barbarians to walk this path, current followers of this path can display thorns, spines, or boney growths while raging.\n\n##### Blossoming Thorns\nBeginning at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, hard, sharp thorns emerge over your whole body, turning your unarmed strikes into dangerous weapons. When you hit with an unarmed strike while raging, your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, while raging, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.\n  The unarmed strike damage you deal while raging increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 8th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.\n\n##### Thorned Grasp\nAlso at 3rd level, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while raging, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, and it takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns, provided you continue to grapple the creature and are raging. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.\n\n##### Nature's Blessing\nAt 6th level, the thorns you grow while raging become more powerful and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.\n  Alternatively, while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this reaction.\n\n##### Toxic Infusion\nStarting at 10th level, when you enter your rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Thorn Barrage\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to shoot the thorns from your body while raging. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

      "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, Equipment) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.",

The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). \n \n**Life Domain Spells (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Spells                               | \n|--------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   | \n| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon | \n| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             | \n| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        | \n| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         | \n \n##### Bonus Proficiency \n \nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. \n \n##### Disciple of Life \n \nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. \n \n##### Blessed Healer \n \nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Divine Strike \n \nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. \n \n##### Supreme Healing \n \nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.",

          "slug": "blood-domain",
          "desc": "The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within ones own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirits anchor within the mortal shell. The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within ones own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance./n When casting divine spells as a Blood Domain cleric, consider ways to occasionally flavor your descriptions to tailor the magics effect on the opponents blood and vitality. Hold person might involve locking a targets body into place from the blood stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations. Guardian of faith could be a floating, crimson spirit of dripping viscera who watches the vicinity with burning red eyes. Have fun with the themes!\n\n **Blood Domain Spells**\n | Cleric Level | Spells                                | \n |--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n | 1st          | *sleep*, *ray of sickness*                | \n | 3rd          | *ray of enfeeblement*, *crown of madness* | \n | 5th          | *haste*, *slow*                           | \n | 7th          | *blight*, *stoneskin*                     | \n | 9th          | *dominate person*, *hold monster*         |\n\n ##### Bonus Proficiencies\nAt 1st Level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.\n\n ##### Bloodletting Focus\nFrom 1st level, your divine magics draw the blood from inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your nearby foes. When you use a spell of 1st level or higher to damage to any creatures that have blood, those creatures suffer additional necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spells level.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creatures actions against their will. As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature that has blood within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately move up to half of their movement in any direction of your choice and make a single weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range. Dead or unconscious creatures automatically fail their saving throw. At 8th level, you can target a Huge or smaller creature.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond\nStarting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to focus on a sample of blood from a creature that is at least 2 ounces, and that has been spilt no longer than a week ago. As an action, you can focus on the blood of the creature to form a bond and gain information about their current circumstances. You know their approximate distance and direction from you, as well as their general state of health, as long as they are within 10 miles of you. You can maintain Concentration on this bond for up to 1 hour.\nDuring your bond, you can spend an action to attempt to connect with the bonded creatures senses. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, the connection is resisted, ending the bond. You suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Upon a failed saving throw, you can choose to either see through the eyes of or hear through their ears of the target for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). During this time, you are blind or deaf (respectively) with regard to your own senses. Once this connection ends, the Crimson Bond is lost.\n\n **Health State Examples**\n | 100%    | Untouched            | \n | 99%-50% | Injured              | \n | 49%-1%  | Heavily Wounded      | \n | 0%      | Unconscious or Dying | \n |        | Dead                 |\n\n ##### Sanguine Recall\nAt 8th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots. As an action, you recover spell slots that have a combined level equal to or less than half of your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You immediately suffer 1d6 damage per spell slot level recovered. You cant use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if youre a 4th-level Cleric, you can recover up to two levels of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. You then suffer 2d6 damage.\n\n ##### Vascular Corruption Aura\nAt 17th level, you can emit a powerful aura as an action that extends 30 feet out from you that pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes, causing them to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any enemy creatures with blood that begin their turn within the aura or enter it for the first time on their turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any enemy creature with blood that would regain hit points while within the aura only regains half of the intended number of hit points (rounded up).\nOnce you use this feature, you cant use it again until you finish a long rest.",

When such creatures become particularly aggressive or can't be dissuaded by local druids, the settlements often call on servants of gods of the hunt to solve the problem.\n  Deities devoted to hunting value champions who aid skillful hunters or who lead hunts themselves. Similarly, deities focused on protecting outlier settlements or who promote strengthening small communities also value such clerics. While these clerics might not have the utmost capability for tracking and killing prey, their gods grant them blessings to ensure successful hunts. These clerics might use their abilities to ensure their friends and communities have sufficient food to survive difficult times, or they might enjoy the sport of pursuing and slaying intelligent prey.\n\n**Hunt Domain Spells**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                                 | \n|--------------|----------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *bloodbound*, *illuminate spoor*       | \n| 3rd          | *instant snare*, *mark prey*           | \n| 5th          | *going in circles*, *tracer*           | \n| 7th          | *heart-seeking arrow*, *hunting stand* | \n| 9th          | *harrying hounds*, *maim*              |\n\n##### Blessing of the Hunter\nAt 1st level, you gain proficiency in Survival. You can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiency\nAt 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Heart Strike\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to inflict grievous wounds. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to add +5 to the attack's damage. If you score a critical hit with the attack, add +10 to the attack's damage instead.\n\n##### Pack Hunter\nStarting at 6th level, when an ally within 30 feet of you makes a weapon attack roll against a creature you attacked within this round, you can use your reaction to grant that ally advantage on the attack roll.\n\n##### Divine Strike\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Deadly Stalker\nAt 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see within 120 feet. For 24 hours or until the target is dead, whichever occurs first, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your target and Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect your target. In addition, you have advantage on weapon attack rolls against the target. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.",

          "desc": "Mercy can mean promoting healing instead of harm, but it can also mean ending suffering with a quick death. These often-contradictory ideals are the two sides of mercy. The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.\n **Mercy Domain Spells (table)**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                              | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *divine favor*, *healing word*      | \n| 3rd          | *aid*, *ray of enfeeblement*        | \n| 5th          | *bardo*, *revivify*                 | \n| 7th          | *death ward*, *sacrificial healing* | \n| 9th          | *antilife shell*, *raise dead*      |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you take your place on the line between the two aspects of mercy: healing and killing. You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with the poisoner's kit. In addition, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.\n\n##### Threshold Guardian\nAlso at 1st level, when you hit a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, the weapon deals extra radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to half your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Involuntary Aid\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wrest the lifeforce from an injured creature and use it to heal allies. As an action, you present your holy symbol to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that doesn't have all of its hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to three times your cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, one friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target.\n\n##### Bolster the Living\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to manipulate a portion of the lifeforce that escapes a creature as it perishes. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel a portion of that energy into a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The friendly creature gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Divine Strike of Mercy\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dual nature of mercy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. If the target dies from this attack, a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If no friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you regain the hit points instead. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Hand of Grace and Execution\nAt 17th level, you imbue the two sides of mercy into your spellcasting. Once on each of your turns, if you cast a spell that restores hit points to one creature or deals damage to one creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the amount of hit points restored or damage dealt.",

See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.\n\n**Portal Domain Spells**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                                    | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *adjust position*, *expeditious retreat*  | \n| 3rd          | *glyph of shifting*, *misty step*         | \n| 5th          | *dimensional shove*, *portal jaunt*       | \n| 7th          | *dimension door*, *reposition*            | \n| 9th          | *pierce the veil*, *teleportation circle* |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools (your choice). In addition, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.\n\n##### Portal Magic\nStarting at 1st level, you gain access to spells that connect places or manipulate the space between places. Each spell with (liminal) listed alongside its school is a cleric spell for you, even if it doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, and you can prepare it as you would any other spell on the cleric spell list. Liminal spells include *bardo*, *devouring darkness*, *door of the far traveler*, *ethereal stairs*, *hypnagogia*, *hypnic jerk*, *mind maze*, *mirror realm*, *pierce the veil*, *reciprocating portal*, *rive*, *subliminal aversion*, and *threshold slip*. See the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells.\n\n##### Portal Bond\nAt 1st level, you learn to forge a bond between yourself and another creature. At the end of a short or long rest, you can touch one willing creature, establishing a magical bond between you. While bonded to a creature, you know the direction to the creature, though not its exact location, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence. As an action, you can teleport the bonded creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or to the nearest unoccupied space, provided the bonded creature is willing and within a number of miles of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Alternatively, you can teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature.\n  Once you teleport a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can have only one bonded creature at a time. If you bond yourself to a new creature, the bond on the previous creature ends. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you die or dismiss it as an action.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Dimensional Shift\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the magic of portals and teleportation. As an action, you teleport a willing target you can see, other than yourself, to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can teleport an unwilling target. An unwilling target that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw is unaffected.\n\n##### Portal Touch\nAt 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a small portal in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. This portal lasts for 1 minute, and it doesn't occupy the space where you create it. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can touch any creature within your reach or within 5 feet of the portal. While the portal is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the portal up to 30 feet. The portal must remain within 30 feet of you. If you or the portal are ever more than 30 feet apart, the portal fades. You can have only one portal active at a time. If you create another one, the previous portal fades.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Transpositional Divine Strike\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to imbue your weapon strikes with portal magic. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal damage to the target as normal, and you open a brief portal next to your target or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature takes 1d8 damage of your weapon's type as a duplicate of your weapon lashes out at the creature from the portal. When you reach 14th level, you can choose two creatures, creating a portal next to each and dealing 1d8 damage of your weapon's type to each. Alternatively, you can choose one creature and deal 2d8 damage to it.\n\n##### Portal Mastery\nAt 17th level, when you see a creature use a magical gateway, teleport, or cast a spell that would teleport itself or another creature, you can use your reaction to reroute the effect, changing the destination to be an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 100 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use this feature again.",

You decide what your new form looks like, including height, weight, facial features, vocal tone, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. This feature works like the Change Appearance aspect of the *alter self* spell, except it lasts until you finish a short or long rest.\n  In addition, when you are reduced to less than half your hit point maximum, you can end this transformation as a reaction to regain hit points equal to 3 times your cleric level.

If the creature fails the saving throw, it is restrained by its shadow until the end of your next turn. If the creature succeeds, it is grappled by its shadow until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature even if the target is in an area where it casts no shadow.\n\n##### Fade to Black\nAt 6th level, you can conceal yourself in shadow. As a bonus action when you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically become invisible for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

A vermin's responses, if any, are limited by its intelligence and typically convey the creature's current or most recent state, such as hungry or in danger.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Swarm Step\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to evade attackers.

You ignore a creatures necrotic resistance when you deal damage via spells or your Channel Divinity.\n\n##### Divine Strike\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

Deities like Loki and Veles are primarily antagonistic to their respective pantheons, but their mercurial nature means they might make the odd alliance with their more serious kin. Gods associated with the moon, like Hecate, mirror the moons changing shape as patrons of mischief. Gods of fortune, like Tyche and Bes, are often tricksters who make their own luck. Meanwhile, culture heroes like Kokopelli, Lemminkinen, and Maui often use deceit to bring prosperity to their people. These diverse deities count among their worshippers criminals, freedom fighters, and free spirits alike, united only by their willingness to upset the status quo.

As an action, you may touch a willing creature, and that creature gains advantage when making Dexterity (Stealth) checks for the next hour. The effect ends early if you use the feature on a different creature. You may not use this feature on yourself.\n\n#### Channel Divinity: Double Trouble\n\nOnce you reach 2nd level, you gain the power to create an illusory double of yourself with the Channel Divinity class feature. You may use your action to manifest the illusion in an unoccupied space visible to you and within 30 feet of yourself. You must concentrate to maintain the illusion as if it were a spell, and you can do so for up to 1 minute. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move up to 30 feet, but it must remain in your view and cannot move more than 120 feet away from you.\n\nWhile you maintain the illusion, when you cast a spell, you can use the position of the illusion rather than your own for determining range, area of effect, and line of sight. However, you cannot actually see through the illusions eyes, so you must rely on your own vision if the spell requires you to see a target or space.\n\nYour illusion can disorient foes, so you gain advantage on attack rolls against any creature that can see the illusion if both you and the illusion are within 5 feet of the creature.\n\n#### Channel Divinity: Walk Unseen\n\nBeginning at 6th level, with your Channel Divinity feature, you can use an action to become invisible. This invisibility lasts until the end of your next turn, or if you cast a spell or attack.\n\n#### Divine Strike\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n#### Double Trouble Doubled\n\nStarting at 17th level, your Double Trouble feature becomes more potent.

Whatever their character, the awesome power of their wrath cannot be denied.\n\n**Storm Domain Spells (table)**\n\n| Cleric Level | Spells                               |\n|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1st          | fog cloud, thunderwave          |\n| 3rd          | gust of wind, shatter           |\n| 5th          | call lightning, sleet storm     |\n| 7th          | control water, ice storm        |\n| 9th          | destructive wave, insect plague |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiency\n\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor as well as with martial weapons.\n\n##### Tempests Rebuke\n\nAlso starting at 1st level, you can strike back at your adversaries with thunder and lightning. If a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to target it with this ability. The creature must be within 5 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 damage on a failure. On a success, the creature takes only half damage. You may choose to deal either lightning or thunder damage with this ability.\n\nYou may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (at least once). When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Full Fury\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to increase the fury of your storm based attacks. Whenever you would deal lightning or thunder damage from an attack, rather than roll damage, you can use the Channel Divinity feature to deal the maximum possible damage.\n\n##### Storm Blast\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can choose to push a Large or smaller creature up to 10 feet away from you any time you deal lightning damage to it.\n\n##### Divine Strike\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Skys Blessing\n\nStarting at 17th level, you gain a flying speed whenever you are outdoors. Your flying speed is equal to your present walking speed.",

2025-11-14 13:04:29,086 | INFO | The Invisible condition in Dungeons & Dragons has several effects:

1. **Visibility**: An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is considered heavily obscured. However, the creature's location can still be detected by any noise it makes or tracks it leaves.

2. **Attack Rolls**: Attack rolls against an invisible creature have disadvantage, meaning it's harder for others to hit the creature. Conversely, the invisible creature's attack rolls have advantage, making it easier for the creature to hit others.

3. **Surprise and Concealment**: If you are invisible when rolling for initiative, you have advantage on the roll. Additionally, you are not affected by any effects that require the target to be seen unless the effect's creator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also concealed.

These effects make the Invisible condition a powerful tool for avoiding detection and gaining an edge in combat.

The Sharpshooter feat is designed for characters who specialize in ranged combat. It typically includes benefits such as:

1. **Ignoring Cover**: Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
2. **Extended Range**: You can make attacks at long range without disadvantage.
3. **Powerful Shots**: Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon, you can choose to take a penalty to the attack roll (usually -5) to deal extra damage (usually +10) if the attack hits.

These features make the Sharpshooter feat a popular choice for characters who rely on bows, crossbows, or other ranged weapons.

You MUST follow this ReACT tool-calling protocol. When you need data from the local catalog or Open5e, you MUST call tools.
Do NOT narrate or describe your intentions. Instead, output exactly one tool call block:
  <CALL>{"fn":"function_name","args":{...}}</CALL>
After the system executes the tool, it will append a system message beginning with:
  Observation: { ... }
You may think again, optionally call more tools, and ONLY AFTER calling fetch_and_cache, produce the final user-facing answer.
Never include <CALL> in your final answer.

Available functions:
- look_monster_table(query:str, limit:int=20)
- search_table(type:str, name_or_slug:str, prefer_doc:str|None)
- fetch_and_cache(type:str, slug:str)

Supported resource types (for search_table & fetch_and_cache):
  monsters, spells, equipment, backgrounds, classes,
  conditions, documents, feats, planes, races,
  sections, spelllist

2025-11-14 13:05:00,546 | INFO | It seems that the "Lucky" feat is not available in the current Open5e database or the specified documents. This feat might be part of a source not included in the Open5e SRD or other available resources. However, I can provide a general description based on typical Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules:

The "Lucky" feat generally allows a character to reroll dice. When you take this feat, you typically gain a number of luck points (usually three) that you can use to reroll an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can choose to spend one luck point after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. This can give you a significant advantage in critical situations.

For the most accurate and detailed description, please refer to the official Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook or other official sourcebooks.

However, based on general Dungeons & Dragons lore, the Feywild is a vibrant and magical plane parallel to the Material Plane. It is known for its intense emotions, heightened senses, and unpredictable nature. The Feywild is home to fey creatures like elves, pixies, and dryads, and is ruled by powerful archfey. Time and space can behave unpredictably in the Feywild, making it a place of wonder and danger for travelers.

The Nine Hells, also known as Baator, is a plane of existence in Dungeons & Dragons that is characterized by its strict hierarchy and lawfulness, despite being a realm of evil. It consists of nine distinct layers, each ruled by a powerful devil lord. The layers are:

1. **Avernus**: The first layer, often depicted as a war-torn battlefield.
2. **Dis**: A vast city of iron ruled by Dispater.
3. **Minauros**: A swampy realm of greed and corruption.
4. **Phlegethos**: A fiery domain of lava and fire.
5. **Stygia**: A frozen sea ruled by the archdevil Levistus.
6. **Malbolge**: A mountainous realm of treachery and deceit.
7. **Maladomini**: A ruined cityscape of decay and despair.
8. **Cania**: An icy wasteland of betrayal.
9. **Nessus**: The deepest layer, home to Asmodeus, the ruler of the Nine Hells.

Each layer has its own unique environment and challenges, and the devils that inhabit the Nine Hells are known for their cunning and desire to corrupt souls. The Nine Hells is a place where law and evil intersect, making it a complex and dangerous realm for adventurers.

2025-11-14 13:05:44,149 | INFO | It seems that the Open5e database does not have specific entries for the Shadowfell or its alternative names like the Plane of Shadow or Shadow Plane. However, I can provide a general description based on typical Dungeons & Dragons lore.

The Shadowfell is a plane of existence that serves as a dark reflection of the Material Plane. It is characterized by its gloomy and shadowy environment, where the landscape is often twisted and bleak. The Shadowfell is associated with death, decay, and the undead, and it is inhabited by creatures such as shadows, wraiths, and other spectral entities.

Travelers to the Shadowfell often find that their emotions are dulled, and the plane's oppressive atmosphere can weigh heavily on their spirits. It is a place where the boundaries between life and death are thin, making it a common setting for adventures involving necromancy or journeys to the afterlife.

For more detailed information, you may want to refer to specific D&D sourcebooks or campaign settings that explore the Shadowfell in greater depth.

- **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is an ancient language often used in magic, known for its harsh sounds.
- **Draconic Ancestry:** You have draconic ancestry, which determines your breath weapon and damage resistance. You choose a dragon type from a table that includes options like Black (Acid), Blue (Lightning), and Red (Fire), among others.
- **Breath Weapon:** You can use your action to exhale destructive energy, with the type and shape determined by your draconic ancestry. The damage increases as you level up.
- **Damage Resistance:** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

These traits make Dragonborn a unique and powerful race, often embodying the characteristics of the dragons they descend from.

2025-11-14 13:06:42,681 | INFO | It seems that the "Adventuring" section is not directly available in the database. However, I can provide a general overview of what adventuring typically involves in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons.

Adventuring in Dungeons & Dragons generally includes the following aspects:

1. **Travel and Exploration**: This involves moving through different terrains, navigating maps, and discovering new locations. Players often encounter various challenges such as difficult terrain, weather conditions, and the need for food and rest.

2. **Encounters and Combat**: Adventuring often leads to encounters with creatures, which can result in combat. Players must strategize and use their skills and abilities to overcome these challenges.

3. **Resource Management**: Players must manage resources such as hit points, spell slots, equipment, and consumables like potions and rations. Efficient resource management is crucial for survival during long adventures.

4. **Role-Playing and Interaction**: Adventuring includes interacting with non-player characters (NPCs), making decisions that affect the story, and role-playing to develop characters' personalities and relationships.

5. **Problem Solving and Puzzles**: Adventurers often face puzzles and traps that require creative thinking and teamwork to solve.

6. **Rewards and Progression**: Successful adventuring leads to rewards such as experience points, treasure, and new abilities or skills, allowing characters to grow and progress.

If you have specific questions about any of these aspects or need details on a particular rule, feel free to ask!

2025-11-14 13:06:46,992 | INFO | It seems that the "Adventuring" section is not available in the database. However, I can provide a general overview of what adventuring typically involves in a tabletop role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons.

Adventuring in Dungeons & Dragons generally includes the following aspects:

1. **Travel and Exploration**: This involves moving through different terrains, navigating maps, and discovering new locations. Players often encounter various challenges such as difficult terrain, weather conditions, and the need for food and rest.

2. **Encounters and Combat**: Adventuring often leads to encounters with creatures, which can result in combat. Players must strategize and use their skills and abilities to overcome these challenges.

3. **Resource Management**: Players must manage resources such as hit points, spell slots, equipment, and consumables like potions and rations. Efficient resource management is crucial for survival during long adventures.

4. **Role-Playing and Interaction**: Adventuring includes interacting with non-player characters (NPCs), making decisions that affect the story, and role-playing to develop characters' personalities and relationships.

5. **Problem Solving and Puzzles**: Adventurers often face puzzles and traps that require creative thinking and teamwork to solve.

6. **Rewards and Progression**: Successful adventuring leads to rewards such as experience points, treasure, and new abilities or skills, allowing characters to grow and progress.

If you have specific questions about any of these aspects or need details on a particular rule, feel free to ask!

      "desc": "Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a spell.\n\nThis chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\n\n## What Is a Spell?\n\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.\n\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\n\nUncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\n\n## Spell Level\n\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) _magic missile_ at 1st level and the earth-shaking _wish_ at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n\nSpell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\n\n## Known and Prepared Spells\n\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.\n\n## Spell Slots\n\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\n\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively filling a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts _magic missile_, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\n\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\n\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\n### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level\n\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts _magic missile_ using one of her 2nd-level slots, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n\nSome spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.\n\n> ## Casting in Armor\n>\n>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\n\n## Cantrips\n\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.\n\n## Rituals\n\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.\n\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.\n\n## Casting a Spell\n\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.\n\nEach spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.\n\n## Casting Time\n\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\n\n### Bonus Action\n\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\n### Reactions\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\n\n### Longer Casting Times\n\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see Concentration below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\n\n## Spell Range\n\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like _magic missile_, the target is a creature. For a spell like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\n\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the _shield_ spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\n\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see Areas of Effect later in the this chapter).\n\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.\n\n## Components\n\nA spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.\n\n### Verbal (V)\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\n### Somatic (S)\n\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\n### Material (M)\n\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in Equipment) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\n\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\n\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\n## Duration\n\nA spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\n\n### Instantaneous\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\n\n### Concentration\n\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\n* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.\n* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\n\n## Targets\n\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\n\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\n### A Clear Path to the Target\n\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.\n\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n\n### Targeting Yourself\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\n\n## Areas of Effect\n\nSpells such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\n\nA spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\n\nA spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\n\n### Cone\n\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.\n\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n### Cube\n\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.\n\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n### Cylinder\n\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\n\nA cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.\n\n### Line\n\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n\nA line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\n### Sphere\n\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\n\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.\n\n## Spell Saving Throws\n\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\n\nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\n\n## Spell Attack Rolls\n\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.\n\n> ## The Schools of Magic\n>\n> Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\n>\n> The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\n>\n> **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\n>\n> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\n>\n> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.\n>\n> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.\n>\n> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.\n>\n> **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\n>\n> **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.\n>\n> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as _animate dead_ is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\n>\n> **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.\n\n## Combining Magical Effects\n\nThe effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\n\nFor example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.",

2025-11-14 13:07:09,632 | INFO | The "Spellcasting" section in the 5e Core Rules provides comprehensive guidelines on how spells function in the game. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **What Is a Spell?**: Spells are magical effects created by manipulating magical energies. They can serve as tools, weapons, or protective measures.

2. **Spell Level**: Spells range from level 0 (cantrips) to level 9, with higher levels indicating more powerful spells. Character level and spell level do not directly correspond.

3. **Known and Prepared Spells**: Spellcasters must have spells fixed in mind or accessible through magic items. The number of spells depends on the character's level.

4. **Spell Slots**: Spellcasters have a limited number of spell slots to cast spells, which are restored after a long rest. Some abilities allow casting without using slots.

5. **Casting a Spell at a Higher Level**: Spells can be cast using higher-level slots for enhanced effects.

6. **Casting in Armor**: Proficiency with armor is required to cast spells without being hampered.

7. **Cantrips**: These are level 0 spells that can be cast at will without using spell slots.

8. **Rituals**: Some spells can be cast as rituals, taking longer but not using spell slots.

9. **Casting a Spell**: Spells have specific casting times, ranges, components, and durations. 

10. **Components**: Spells may require verbal, somatic, or material components.

11. **Duration**: Spells have durations ranging from instantaneous to indefinite, with some requiring concentration.

12. **Targets and Areas of Effect**: Spells can target creatures or areas, with specific rules for targeting and area shapes.

13. **Spell Saving Throws and Attack Rolls**: Targets may make saving throws against spells, and some spells require attack rolls.

14. **Schools of Magic**: Spells are categorized into schools like Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, etc., each with distinct characteristics.

15. **Combining Magical Effects**: Different spells can combine effects, but the same spell cast multiple times does not stack.

For detailed rules and examples, you can refer to the full text of the "Spellcasting" section in the 5e Core Rules.

You MUST follow this ReACT tool-calling protocol. When you need data from the local catalog or Open5e, you MUST call tools.
Do NOT narrate or describe your intentions. Instead, output exactly one tool call block:
  <CALL>{"fn":"function_name","args":{...}}</CALL>
After the system executes the tool, it will append a system message beginning with:
  Observation: { ... }
You may think again, optionally call more tools, and ONLY AFTER calling fetch_and_cache, produce the final user-facing answer.
Never include <CALL> in your final answer.

Available functions:
- look_monster_table(query:str, limit:int=20)
- search_table(type:str, name_or_slug:str, prefer_doc:str|None)
- fetch_and_cache(type:str, slug:str)

Supported resource types (for search_table & fetch_and_cache):
  monsters, spells, equipment, backgrounds, classes,
  conditions, documents, feats, planes, races,

      "name": "Monsters",
      "desc": "A monsters statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.\n\n## Size\n\nA monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the *Players Handbook* for more information on creature size and space.\n\n### Size Categories\n\n| Size | Space | Examples |\n|--------|----------|---------------|\n| Tiny | 2 by 2 ft. | Imp, sprite |\n| Small | 5 b 5 ft. | Giant rat, goblin |\n| Medium | 5 b 5 ft. | Orc, werewolf |\n| Large | 10 b 10 ft. | Hippogriff, ogre |\n| Huge | 15 b 15 ft. | Fire giant, treant |\n| Gargantuan | 20 b 20 ft. or larger | Kraken, purple worm |\n\n#### Modifying Creatures\n\nDespite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a variant or template, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.\n\n## Type\n\nA monsters type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.\n\nThe game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.\n\n**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creatures alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.\n\n**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.\n\n**Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.\n\n**Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.\n\n**Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.\n\n**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers and invisible stalkers.\n\n**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.\n\n**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.\n\n**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.\n\n**Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.\n\n**Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest sensefrightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that dont fit into any other type.\n\n**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.\n\n**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.\n\n**Undead** are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.\n\n### Tags\nA monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.\n\n## Alignment\n\nA monsters alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the *Players Handbook* for descriptions of the different alignments.\n\nThe alignment specified in a monsters stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monsters alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, theres nothing stopping you.\n\nSome creatures can have **any alignment**. In other words, you choose the monsters alignment. Some monsters alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.\n\nMany creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They dont make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they dont have an alignment.\n\n## Armor Class\n\nA monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monsters AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.\n\n## Hit Points\n\nA monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the *Players Handbook*.\n\nA monsters hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2  4).\n\nA monsters size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.\n\n### Hit Dice by Size\n\n| Monster Size | Hit Die | Average HP per Die |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------------------|\n| Tiny | d4 | 2 |\n| Small | d6 | 3 |\n| Medium | d8 | 4 |\n| Large | d10 | 5 |\n| Huge | d12 | 6 |\n| Gargantuan | d20 | 10 |\n\nA monsters Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).\n\n## Speed\n\nA monsters speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the *Players Handbook*.\n\nAll creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monsters speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.\n\nSome creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.\n\n### Burrow\n\nA monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster cant burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.\n\n### Climb\n\nA monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesnt need to spend extra movement to climb.\n\n### Fly\n\nA monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in the *Players Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.\n\n### Swim\n\nA monster that has a swimming speed doesnt need to spend extra movement to swim.\n\n## Ability Scores\n\nEvery monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how theyre used in play, see the *Players Handbook*.\n\n## Saving Throws\n\nThe Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isnt easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures dont have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.\n\nA saving throw bonus is the sum of a monsters relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monsters challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).\n\n### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating\n\n| Challenge | Proficiency Bonus |\n|---------------|--------------------------|\n| 0 | +2 |\n| \u215b | +2 |\n|  | +2 |\n|  |+2 |\n| 1 | +2 |\n| 2 | +2 |\n| 3 | +2 |\n| 4 | +2 |\n| 5 | +3 |\n| 6 | +3 |\n| 7 | +3 |\n| 8 | +3 |\n| 9 | +4 |\n| 10 | +4 |\n| 11 | +4 |\n| 12 | +4 |\n| 13 | +5 |\n| 14 | +5 |\n| 15 | +5 |\n| 16 | +5 |\n| 17 | +6 |\n| 18 | +6 |\n| 19 | +6 |\n| 20 | +6 |\n| 21 | +7 |\n| 22 | +7 |\n| 23 | +7 |\n| 24 | +7 |\n| 25 | +8 |\n| 26 | +8 |\n| 27 | +8 |\n| 28 | +8 |\n| 29 | +9 |\n| 30 | +9 |\n\n## Skills\n\nThe Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\nA skill bonus is the sum of a monsters relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monsters challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.\n\n### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies\n\nAssume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.\n\nFor example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.\n\nSee the *Players Handbook* for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.\n\n## Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities\n\nSome creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.\n\n## Senses\n\nThe Senses entry notes a monsters passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.\n\n### Blindsight\n\nA monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.\n\nCreatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.\n\nIf a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.\n\n### Darkvision\n\nA monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.\n\n### Tremorsense\n\nA monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense cant be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.\n\n### Truesight\n\nA monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.\n\n## Languages\n\nThe languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but cant speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A \"\" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.\n\n### Telepathy\n\nTelepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesnt need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but cant initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.\n\nA telepathic monster doesnt need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it cant initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.\n\nA creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesnt function cant send or receive telepathic messages.\n\n## Challenge\n\nA monsters **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.\n\nMonsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.\n\nSome monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.\n\n### Experience Points\n\nThe number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.\n\nUnless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.\n\n#### Experience Points by Challenge Rating\n\n| Challenge | XP |\n|---------------|------|\n| 0 | 0 or 10 |\n| \u215b | 25 |\n|  | 50 |\n|  |100 |\n| 1 | 200 |\n| 2 | 450 |\n| 3 | 700 |\n| 4 | 1,100 |\n| 5 | 1,800 |\n| 6 | 2,300 |\n| 7 | 2,900 |\n| 8 | 3,900 |\n| 9 | 5,000 |\n| 10 | 5,900 |\n| 11 | 7,200 |\n| 12 | 8,400 |\n| 13 | 10,000 |\n| 14 | 11,500 |\n| 15 | 13,000 |\n| 16 | 15,000 |\n| 17 | 18,000 |\n| 18 | 20,000 |\n| 19 | 22,000 |\n| 20 | 25,000 |\n| 21 | 33,000 |\n| 22 | 41,000 |\n| 23 | 50,000 |\n| 24 | 62,000 |\n| 25 | 75,000 |\n| 26 | 90,000 |\n| 27 | 105,000 |\n| 28 | 120,000 |\n| 29 | 135,000 |\n| 30 | 155,000 |\n\n## Special Traits\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monsters challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\n### Innate Spellcasting\n\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and cant be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monsters challenge rating.\n\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a self only restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\n\nA monsters innate spells cant be swapped out with other spells. If a monsters innate spells dont require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.\n\n### Spellcasting\n\nA monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the *Players Handbook*). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.\n\nThe monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.\n\nA monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level *lightning bolt* spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.\n\nYou can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.\n\n### Psionics\n\nA monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesnt require any components to cast its spells.\n\n## Actions\n\nWhen a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the *Players Handbook*.\n\n### Melee and Ranged Attacks\n\nThe most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the weapon might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks, see the *Players Handbook*.\n\n***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a target can be a creature or an object.\n\n***Hit.*** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"*Hit*\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.\n\n***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"*Miss:*\" notation.\n\n### Multiattack\n\nA creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature cant use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.\n\n### Ammunition\nA monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.\n\n## Reactions\n\nIf a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.\n\n## Limited Usage\n\nSome special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.\n\n***X/Day.*** The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.\n\n***Recharge XY.*** The notation \"Recharge XY\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monsters turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, \"Recharge 56\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monsters turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.\n\n***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.\n   \n#### Grapple Rules for Monsters\n\nMany monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesnt need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.\n\nA creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monsters stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monsters Strength (Athletics) modifier.\n\n## Equipment\n\nA stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.\n\nYou can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monsters equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.\n\nIf a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.\n\n# Legendary Creatures\n\nA legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures cant. It can take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical influence for miles around.\n\nIf a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through a spell, it doesnt gain that forms legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.\n\n## Legendary Actions\n\nA legendary creature can take a certain number of special actionscalled legendary actionsoutside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it cant use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it cant use them until after its first turn in the combat.\n\n## A Legendary Creatures Lair\n\nA legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.\n\n### Lair Actions\n\nIf a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It cant do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it cant use one until after its first turn in the combat.\n\n### Regional Effects\n\nThe mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.",

2025-11-14 13:08:40,290 | INFO | I was unable to find a specific document or section titled "Spells" or "Spellcasting" in the SRD 2014. However, the SRD typically includes individual spell entries and rules related to spellcasting within various sections. If you are interested in a specific spell or aspect of spellcasting, please let me know, and I can assist you in finding that information.
