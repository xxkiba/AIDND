2025-11-14 12:39:32,137 | INFO | It seems that I am unable to retrieve the specific entry for "Studded Leather Armor" from the database. However, I can provide you with general information about it in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.

Studded Leather Armor is a type of light armor. It consists of a leather base with metal studs or rivets added for additional protection. Here are its typical characteristics:

- **Armor Class (AC):** 12 + Dexterity modifier
- **Weight:** 13 pounds
- **Cost:** 45 gold pieces
- **Stealth:** No disadvantage

Studded Leather Armor is favored by characters who rely on agility and stealth, such as rogues and rangers, because it provides a good balance between protection and mobility without imposing a disadvantage on stealth checks.

1. **Speed Reduction**: A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

2. **Ending the Condition**: The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (unable to take actions or reactions). It also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the Thunderwave spell.

These rules ensure that a grappled creature is restrained in terms of movement but can still perform other actions, such as attacking or casting spells, as long as those actions do not require movement.

2025-11-14 12:39:53,789 | INFO | The Sage background in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition represents a character who has spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. Sages are often scholars, researchers, or librarians who have a deep thirst for knowledge. Here are some key features of the Sage background:

1. **Skill Proficiencies**: Arcana and History.
2. **Languages**: You learn two additional languages of your choice.
3. **Equipment**: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.
4. **Feature - Researcher**: When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

Sages are typically characterized by their curiosity and dedication to uncovering the mysteries of the world, making them valuable sources of information and insight in any adventuring party.

4. **Feature - Researcher**: When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it.

Here is a summary of the Sage background:

- **Skill Proficiencies**: Arcana and History.
