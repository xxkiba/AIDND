No one ever said adventuring came with a guarantee of success. Now, the time has come to set off toward danger once again. The reasons for picking up adventuring again vary. Could it be a calamitous threat to the town? The region? The world? Was the settled life not what you expected? Or did your past finally catch up to you? In the end, all that matters is diving back into danger. And it's time to show these new folks how it's done.\r\n\r\n### Reason for Retirement\r\nGiving up your first adventuring career was a turning point in your life.
